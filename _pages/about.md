&ensp;&ensp;I am a current graduate student in research computer science and technology, expected to graduate at the end of May 2024, with a research interest in critical node identification (node ranking) for complex networks. I am also very interested in **graph computing**, **graph representation learning**, and **critical node mining in knowledge graphs**.
