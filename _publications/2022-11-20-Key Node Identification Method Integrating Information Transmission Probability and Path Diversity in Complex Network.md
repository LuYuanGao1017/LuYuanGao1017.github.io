&emsp;&emsp;In this work, we consider the path diversity of information propagation between nodes, while removing some of the duplicate paths from the computation. The conclusions show that different complex networks have different optimal propagation path computation lengths to obtain the closest value of influence per node obtained from the SIR model. However, there is a problem of high computational time complexity. The subsequent work uses GCN to learn the structural information of the nodes as well as to augment the features of the nodes, and most novelly, we propose **a new way to obtain the node features**. The second paper is in submission, please look forward to our improvement.
