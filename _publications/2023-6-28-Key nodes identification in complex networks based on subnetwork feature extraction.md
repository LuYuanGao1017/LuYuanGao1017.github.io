&emsp;&emsp;In this work we propose a subgraph extraction method and obtain node features through subgraphs. As opposed to the path diversity proposed in the first work, we calculate the diversity of paths in the subgraph to measure the importance of nodes as features. Finally, the structural features of the whole graph are obtained using a graph convolutional neural network. The two are combined to finally regress to obtain the importance of nodes.
